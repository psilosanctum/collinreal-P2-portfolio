# Summary/Abstract

The analysis's objective is to understand the insights and patterns recognized between customer demographics and their financial situation.

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Introduction

## General Background Information

Customer demographics, such as religion, gender, height, and weight were analyzed to identify which of these demographics had more significant influences on an individual's investments.

## Description of data and data source

The two variables I added to the data sheet are Religion and Investments. The Religion variable seeks to identify the spiritual beliefs, if any, of each individual. The Investments variable represents the total fair market value of an individual's investment accounts.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Can individual's be clustered into groups based on their demographics and the fair market value of their investment accounts?
If so, how do we use these clusters to gain a competitive advantage?

# Methods

We used R to import, clean, and run analysis on the data.

## Data aquisition

Dummy data was used for this report.

## Data import and cleaning

#### Import libraries.
```{r}

library(readxl) #for loading Excel files
library(dplyr) #for data processing/cleaning
library(tidyr) #for data processing/cleaning
library(skimr) #for nice visualization of data 
library(here) #to set paths
```

#### Import Data
```{r}
data_location <- here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","raw-data","exampledata2.xlsx")
rawdata <- readxl::read_excel(data_location)
print(rawdata)
```

#### Check Data
```{r}
codebook <- readxl::read_excel(data_location, sheet ="Codebook")
print(codebook)
```

#### Descriptive Statistics
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(rawdata)
summary(rawdata)
head(rawdata)
skimr::skim(rawdata)
```

#### Data Cleaning
```{r}
d1 <- rawdata %>% dplyr::filter( Height != "sixty" ) %>% 
                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))

d2 <- d1 %>% dplyr::mutate( Height = replace(Height, Height=="6",round(6*30.48,0)))

d3 <- d2 %>%  dplyr::filter(Weight != 7000) %>% tidyr::drop_na()
d3$Gender <- as.factor(d3$Gender)
d4 <- d3 %>% dplyr::filter( !(Gender %in% c("NA","N")) ) %>% droplevels()  
processeddata <- d4
processeddata
```
## Statistical analysis

One linear model was created with height as our dependent variable and weight/religion as our predictors.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable1
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE

resulttable1 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","summarytable.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable1)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

### Distribution of Height by Religion
```{r}
#| label: fig-result-boxplot
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of height by religion."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","code","eda-code","boxplot.png"))
```

### Correlation Between Investments and Weight
```{r}
#| label: fig-result-scatterplot
#| fig-cap: "The relationship between investments and weight."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","code","eda-code","scatterplot.png"))
```

### Investments/Religious Influence on Height
```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

Two diagnostic plots were created to visualize the data. The box plot identifies the distribution of data among the categorical variable Religion and helps identify potential outliers. Our box plots demonstrate few variation in height for all religions except Mormonism. The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the Weight and Investments variables (i.e. their degree of correlation). The scatter plot does not show much correlation between the two variables.

## Strengths and Limitations

One major limitation is the small sample size. It's difficult to identify patterns when a lack of data is present. Another limitation is not creating additional plots for other combinations of variables. One strength is the level of demographic data which is essential for market segmentation.

## Conclusions
One of the key takeaways from this project is the importance of data acquisition and validating it's integrity. Small samples sizes and junk data limit the opportunity of producing valuable insights. Data is the most critical asset for predictive modeling. If the integrity of a dataset is in question, so are the results of every model built on top of it.

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
